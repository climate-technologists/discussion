# Climate Technologists

Climate Technologists is a group of technologists who are working together to drastically reduce the damage of climate change using the leverage of technology.

This group is inspired by the work of Bret Victor, who wrote the fantastic [What Can A Technologist Do About Climate Change](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange), which was recently discussed on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19259106).

If you can donate a few hours here and there for coding, devops, marketing, design, or product management, please submit a request to join the organization.

If you have interest in working on a solution to a problem, please create an issue for it and add it here.
